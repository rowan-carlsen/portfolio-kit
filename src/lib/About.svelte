<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
<p>
    I create engaging and interactive educational content online, combining web
    design expertise with 10+ years of experience as a teacher and a manager for
    teachers. My goal is to integrate the learning design sensibilities of
    in-person teaching with the expansive possibilities afforded by modern web
    technology.
